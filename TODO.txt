Add support for:
- Clock cycles
- Observer Pattern in Memory
    * Implement a simple monitor and run code from 6502asm.com ?
- Intel HEX and SREC format
- Running binaries :)

Refactor:
- Mpu6502::step():
    * Try to cut down on 'set_nz_flag' and 'reg.pc += 1' somehow
    * Perhaps prefetch ubyte/uword with values, according to a lookup table (like with cycles now)?
- TestSuite:
    * Set up the MPU's memory/register before we start executing
    * Allow for asserts like 'assert reg.ac reg.x'
    * Allow for specifying origin of executable code
    * Create some other method of testing; perhaps port a testsuit from another emulator? Py65?

Add tests for:
- More complex tests, like computing primes or something
- I don't think there's any tests for SBC/ADC when we already have carry/borrow
